So, I need to introduce a GUI that will allow therapists to use this w/o knowing how to code.

So, question: What do they need to specify each time?
-1) The lists of phonemes. 
     -1a) Create new Phoneme list -
         1ai) Name it
         1aii) Which glyphs are in it
      -1b) Modify existing Phoneme
          1bi) Remove some glyphs
          1bii) Add some glyphs
          1biii) name it
-2) The order of phonemes to use.
-3) Which phoneme has highest priority
-4) How many samples to create
